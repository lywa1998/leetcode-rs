# LeetCode Solution in Rust
This repository aims to enhance the Leetcode problem-solving experience for Rust developers by providing test cases and improving the overall coding experience. Unlike the Leetcode official website, which lacks syntax completion and type hints, this repository leverages rust-analyzer for code completion when working locally. By collecting LeetCode problems, this repository strives to create a more user-friendly and efficient coding environment for Rust users. 

## Feature
